If you see no errors then this could be that:
 * the server is shutting down
 * there has been a client authentication failure (please check that your outbound IP address matches that associated with your certificate - note that if your device is subject to NAT then the certificate IP must match the upstream NAT IP)
 * there is a problem with the server. If you are running FMC v6.0, you may need to install "Sourcefire 3D Defense Center S3 Hotfix AZ 6.1.0.3-1"

In order to run eNcore you need to have a public-private key pair issued by your FMC.
This key pair is delivered in a pkcs12 file. In order to generate one you will need
to log into your FMC and navigate to:

    System > Integration > eStreamer

Once there, create a "New client" and enter the IP address of this device as the host.
Please note that the FMC will validate your connection by comparing the IP address it sees
with the IP address in the certificate - if you are behind a NAT device you will need to
adjust the IP address accordingly.

Download and copy the pkcs12 file to:

    {0}

STRING_PYOPENSSL_MISSING = """eNcore is unable to split the PKCS12 file because pyOpenSSL is not installed.

You have two options:

# 1. Install pyOpenSSL using pip: `pip install pyOpenSSL` and eNcore will do it for you

In order to install pip you will need to install the following packages e.g.:

    sudo yum install python-pip python-devel openssl-devel gcc
    sudo pip install pyOpenSSL

If you have problems installing these packages and you are running on CentOS / RHEL
then try enabling the EPEL repo. For more information see:

    https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL


# 2. Alternatively you can use the built in Splunk OpenSSL binary

First, set the SPLUNK_HOME and LD_LIBRARY_PATH path(s) to the location of your Splunk install

(For example. /opt/splunk)
export SPLUNK_HOME=/opt/splunk
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SPLUNK_HOME/lib

Then run the following two commands, alernatively you can use the command line version of OpenSSL

$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/openssl pkcs12 -in "{0}" -nocerts -nodes -out "{1}"
$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/openssl pkcs12 -in "{0}" -clcerts -nokeys -out "{2}"

Note:  If you are using python3 the command to install OpenSSL is as follows

    sudo apt install python3-openssl
